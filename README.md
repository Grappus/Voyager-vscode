## Usage
Simply install the plugin "Voyager", to use press ctrl+shift+p or cmd+shift+p and search for "Voyager". Currently for this plugin to work, you must have package.json in your project (workspace) root.

### Here are some of the major purposes it serves:
1. Reads package.json and presents the details in a separate, friendly view, allowing you to edit the values.
2. Lets you discover, search for packages from npm.
3. Shows the readme, stats and links for any package within VSCode without switching to browser.
4. Lets you install/uninstall/update dependencies with clicks, without switching to terminal
5. Shows the existing version and latest version of installed dependencies, with colored labels indicating how outdated your dependencies might be.
6. Lets you run scripts by clicking on the script blocks.
